I've realized maintaining a whole CMS is massive overkill for a site I don't update much. I heard good things about [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as a static site generator and decided to spend a couple evenings fiddling with it. 

So far, I'm a fan! I like writing in Markdown, and not needing to run a database in the backend is A-OK with me. 

I've gone ahead and migrated the post [Searching For Phrases in Base64-encoded Strings]({{<ref "/base64-key-strings">}}) to this version of the site, along with a redirect for anyone still following the old link to it. It's the only post on my site that ever really got any attention and it's the only one I still feel is worth sharing.

I'd like to put more writing here, we'll see what happens! It's always good to have a project after all.
