Hey, I’m Mikey! 

I’m really into web security, and I've spent a lot of time writing and speaking about it. 

I’m also not great at web design or talking about myself, but here we are.

I’ve worn a few hats, from systems administration to malware analysis and incident response, and I’ve determined that the most rewarding part of learning new things is the ability to teach those things to other people.

I'm currently a cybersecurity educator, teaching everything I can to students from all backgrounds and skill levels.
